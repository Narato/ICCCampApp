<h2>Rules</h2>
<p>
On ICC, there aren’t many rules. The most important ones are to enjoy this event while doing everything safely, and to hopefully learn useful things. However, below are some rules we deem very important to ensure that everyone is able to do so as much as possible.
<ul>
<li>At the ICC-café, as well as everywhere in Leuven, you will be able to get alcoholic drinks. Belgian law allows you to have alcoholic drinks with a low percentage of alcohol such as beer or wine when you are 16 years old, and stronger alcoholic drinks when being 18. When, for example, you want to buy a bottle of wodka in a night shop, you are required to show your identity card. If this law is different in your country, discuss the possibilities with your NC. Please note that it cannot be the meaning to be drunk every night and to have a hang-over while following workshops.
<li>The ICC-café, as well as all other public areas in de Blauwput, close at 01H. To ensure the night’s rest of de Blauwput staff, we ask you to order your last drink, and bring back the board- or card games you borrowed, at 0H45 at the latest. Experience has taught us that many ICC participants aren’t tired yet at this time, so we allow you to go out. Leuven has much to offer, also during the night. However, discuss this with your NC and let them know you are out. If possible, try to find a volunteer or sighted staff to go with you, unless you are sure that you will manage independently. If you still get lost, you can contact Eric Gustin: +32476968578. The Martelarenlaan entrance can be opened with your key card, and the front door closes at 23H.
<li>In Belgium, it is forbidden to smoke in bars, restaurants and other public places. Blauwput and ESAT are public buildings so it is totally excluded to smoke inside. If you do need to smoke, then go outside, make sure you disturb no one and do not leave any rubbish behind.
<li>It is not allowed to bring your own food or drinks into Blauwput. Also, no eating or drinking in the sleeping area, certainly not when you brought a snack or a drink from outside the Blauwput. When thirsty, visit the ICC café or have a glass of tab water, which in Belgium is very safe to drink.
<li>ICC can be much fun, but also a rather tiring experience, and people may want to go to bed earlier. Therefore, try not to be noisy in the sleeping area. If you feel you want to make some noise, stay in the public areas, or when they close, go outside. See above.
<li>On all days, except on Sunday, Breakfast is from 07H to 08H.
<li>Lunch break is between 12H and 13H45, except on Friday 28/7.
<li>Dinner is from 17H45 to 19H.
<li>Drinks and snacks are available between 10H15 and 11H, and between 15H and 15H45. Workshop leaders usually decide when they have their break.
<li>Transfer between Blauwput and the university is by coach. Departure in the morning is at 8h15 and in the afternoon at 17h. On Sunday, departure is at 13H15. Please be punctual. See also the general programme.
<li>Some activities will take place in a gym. Shoes with black soles or high heels are not allowed there.
<li>The showdown room and the board/card games are available every night. The showdown will be until 22H. The games, which you will have to borrow at the bar by giving your name, should be brought back at 0H45 at the latest.
<li>The musical instruments cannot be used when there is no jam session. If you brought your own instrument, you can play it if you wish, but not after 22H.
</ul>

<h2>Other practical info</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>If you missed the coach (between Blauwput and ESAT) or need to return to Blauwput at another time, then you can use public transport. Line 1, line 2 and line 616 operate a frequent and direct connection between the railway station and Kantineplein, the square in front of the university building. Buying a ticket at the driver costs 3 Euro. A cheaper option is to buy a ten trips card which reduces the price of one trip to 1,5 Euro. You can share the card with several people. This card must be bought before boarding the bus.
<li>Workshops are on all days, except Thursday = the excursion, Sunday morning = free morning, and the last Monday afternoon = free afternoon.
<li>The workshops are from 09H to 12H and from 13H45 to 16H45, except Friday 28/7 = ICC’s window to the world. From 09H to 10H, Katlijn Malfliet, former vice rector for diversity at the KU Leuven, and Helga Stevens, European member of parliament, will speak about their vision on inclusion into the society for people with a disability. The morning workshop follows from 10H to 12H40.
<li>Every workshop session starts with a general assembly, where practical announcements will be made and where you will hear which workshop you are about to follow. To be precise, these general assemblies are around 9H and around 13H45.
<li>The first workshop everyone will follow, on Monday 24/7, is a detailed orientation workshop around ESAT, for which you will be divided into small groups. When you are not walking around ESAT, you will get the explanation about how you have to use the ICC framework, and how to obtain the youth pass.
<li>The obligatory workshops you chose on your application form will take place on Monday 24/7 in the afternoon, Tuesday 25/7 in the morning and Saturday 29/7.
<li>Leisure time activities start between 19H and 20H and end between 21H and 22H30.
<li>On Sunday 30/7 in the morning and on Monday 31/7 in the afternoon, you are free. On Sunday: the Christ Minded Chapel, a small Christian group, with the following website: <a href="http://christmindedchapel.com/page-1.html">http://christmindedchapel.com/page-1.html</a>, has its Sunday service in the Blauwput restaurant, and they invited all who is interested, to join. The service starts at 10H.
<li>The farewell party on Monday 31/7 takes place in het Provinciehuis, not far from de Blauwput. Reception is at 17H30, and the first of three dishes will be served around 19H. The acts: see the programme of the leisure time, will take place when dessert is finished. At 23H we leave het Provinciehuis and go to Café Sport, to have the last party.

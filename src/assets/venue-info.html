<h2>About Jeugdherberg De Blauwput</h2>
<p>
This is our hostel, and the title would literally translate as “youth hostel the Blue Pit”. Those who arrived by train, have noticed that it is located very close to the Leuven Station. On there website: <br>
<a href="http://www.leuven-hostel.com/jh_en.html">http://www.leuven-hostel.com/jh_en.html</a>,<br> 
the hostel is described as a modern city hostel. There are 28 bedrooms, each having a private bathroom and individual lockers: 4 rooms with 2 beds, 18 rooms with 4 beds and 6 rooms with 6 beds. Bed sheets are included. Towels can be bought 6 euro per towel and a padlock costs you 10 euros, so it is best to have your own towels. A padlock has been given to you in the backpack you received. See also the packing list. If necessary you can borrow a hair drier or an iron for free. 
The public areas consist of a bar = our ICC café, a lounge, 3 conference rooms that we use for leisure time activities, a courtyard, a lounge room and a storage room for luggage. The building is also wheel chair accessible.
Originally, wifi is only accessible in the public areas, since they want to encourage face to face social contact between the guests. However, we know the importance of having wifi in the rooms as well, if only to contact your friends via whats app to ask where they are…, so we provided our own wifi. The network is called “ICC Hot spot” and the password will be “heverlee”.
One set of tactile maps is provided per country, and an extensive description of the building can be found below.

<h3>The description of the building</h3>
<p>
The building has roughly a rectangular shape. The long edges are parallel to the street called Martelarenlaan. However, there is another building between Blauwput and Martelarenlaan so it is not directly located alongside this street.<br>
The entrance to the Blauwput building is located centrally at the short southern edge of the rectangle. You enter the Blauwput from the square called Benedenplein. During the night, this entrance is locked. You should use the night entrance which is located towards Martelarenlaan.
The building has three floors: ground floor (0), first floor (+1) and second floor (+2).
</P>

<h4>Ground floor (0):</h4>
We enter the building via a short edge of the rectangle. We have a long corridor in front of us that will eventually end in a T-shape.
All daytime rooms are located on the ground floor alongside this long corridor. When we pass them, we enter the sleeping area. The sleeping area is identical on the first and second floors.
The entrance to the building has two consecutive doors. Behind the first one, is on your right an area with toilets, lockers and the luggage room. 
Through the second door you are in the long corridor. Immediately on your left, is the reception and on your right a short corridor that leads to the lounge.
Continuing straight ahead through the long corridor, you find on your right the entrance to the court yard, then the resto hall and then the restaurant. Meanwhile on your left, you will find the entrance to the bar, the small meeting room, the women's toilet, men's toilet, the big meeting room and an accessible toilet. 
The restaurant and the big room sit across from each other. 
The long corridor that was the foot of the T-shape is interrupted by a door leading to the sleeping area. This door will be locked during the night.
When we pass it, we find:<br>
* on our left, first a private room, followed by the door to the night hall with the stair case, and then rooms 1, 3 and 5.<br>
* on our right: an emergency room, a window, the elevator and then rooms: 2, 4 and 6<br>
Past room 5 (on the left) and room 6 (on the right) is the end of the long corridor and starts the T in the form of a crosswise corridor. It contains from left to right rooms 7, 8, 9 and 10. If you turn right, you will find an emergency exit past room 10.
</p>

<h4> floor one (1):</h4>
<p>
The sleeping area on the first floor (+1) is identical to the ground floor (0). Room numbers start with 101 until 110. Also past room 110 is an emergency exit.
</p>
<h4>Floor two (2):</h4>
<p>
The second floor has 8 rooms instead of ten: 201, 203, 205 on the left and 202, 204 and 206 on the right are familiar. In the crosswise corridor are only rooms 207 and 208. Past room 208 is again the emergency exit with stairs leading down.

<h2>About ESAT</h2>
<p>
The department of Electrical Engineering) of the KU Leuven is also known as ESAT 
The ESAT building is located in the Kasteelpark Arenberg, the domain of a castle, constructed in traditionally Flemish style with sand stone window frames and brick walls, with elements of gothic, renaissance and neo gothic style, and once with German eagles on the towers. The castle itself now is the main building of the department of natural sciences and engineering. The castle and its domain were acquired by the university in 1921. ESAT is one of the newer buildings in the park. Our workshops, and the movie nights, will take place there. 
If you are a higher education student, you might notice eduroam is a wifi network you can connect to. Do so if you wish, but everyone got a personal guest account on another network: campusroam, the KU Leuven network, of which you can find the data in your name tag. Eduroam, as well as campusroam are also available in Gebouw De Nayer and the Gymnasium, which you will visit when you chose to follow the sports activities.
Note that you can only connect to the ICC server using the computers in the workshop rooms. On the first Monday morning, you will have an explanation how to log in to the server.
Since the building is rather difficult to navigate in, and since we only provide 1 set of tactile maps per country, you can also find a detailed description below.

<h3>The ESAT building described</h3>
<p>
The building itself is rather rectangular. The right long edge is parallel to the street. 
The building has 8 floors of which we will use 5. We assigned a letter to each floor that we use. The rooms have a letter and a number. The letter refers to the floor and the numbers count the rooms that we use on that floor. We start on the top left with number 1 and continue clockwise.

</dl><br><br>

We enter the building at the basement level A. At this level the building is split by a wide corridor with no roof. In the smaller part are the first 2 rooms: room A1 and room A2 are next to each other and both rooms have 2 entrance doors. Next to room A1 are toilets as well. 
Further in this smaller part of the building are an elevator and staircase behind a door for which we need a badge. This is the only possibility to go to the rooms on the 5th floor.
The entrance for the main building has two glass doors in a 90 degree corner.
Immediately on the left side is the entrance to auditorium A3 and on the right side is first a staircase, secured by a badge, then toilets and a little further is an elevator that can be used without entrance badge. After the elevator on your right side you have some soda dispensers for which you need to pay, and a SIPWELL water cooler, which you can use for free, and is only accessible for us during the ICC camp. 
The normal route is as follows: walk straight ahead, keeping auditorium a3 on your left. When the wall stops, turn left and go up the stairs to reach the ground floor B.<br><br>
Upstairs, turn left and after ten meters you find on your left the entrance to the assembly hall, this is a large auditorium and the place where we will start in the morning.
Across the entrance door of the assembly hall is the door of room B3. Be careful between these two rooms is a “beautiful” art work.
Continuing the corridor past the assembly hall and room B3, you will find, also on the left, the entrance for room B4. Keep going straight until you reach the end of the long corridor, turn right and you find the camp office immediately on your left. 
On this floor B there are two other workshop rooms: B1 and B2. To reach them from the camp office, we have to go all the way back past rooms B4, B3, the assembly hall and the stairs that we used to get to this floor. Continue straight ahead, take a few steps up and then in front of you is a door for which you need a badge. Behind it, is the blue corridor. 
After a few steps, is on the left the staircase to the first floor C or basement A and on the right are toilets. 
Continuing straight, we firstly pass room B2 and then room B1. Be careful, there is a concrete pillar close to the entrance door of room B1. <br><br>

To go to the first floor C, take the staircase in the blue corridor. The first floor C has a red corridor. Similarly to the ground floor B, you find toilets across the staircase. Rooms C2 and C1 are along the red corridor just like on floor B. Be careful close to room C1 is also a concrete pillar. 
On this floor C is also our lunch room. To reach it, go till the end of the red corridor, where room C1 is on your right. Turn left and go through a long, rather narrow corridor with offices to the other side of the building. Almost at the end of this corridor there is a small open area with on the left the elevator (the one that goes to the 5th floor G) and next to it the staircase that leads as well to the 5th floor G. Between this elevator and the staircase are a few steps up that lead us to the Lunch room. In the lunch room, opposite the entrance, under the bridge to the toilets, is another SIPWELL water cooler for us on the ICC camp. There are a lot of water coolers in the building, but only these two are for the icc camp. 
Above the lunchroom are toilets as well (this is not indicated on the map). 
You reach them via the stairs in the right back corner of the lunch room. This is a metal open stair in an L-shape (or braille letter p). Upstairs, continue straight and you will find toilets on your left.<br><br>

The second floor D has three workshop rooms. Rooms D2 and D1 are no surprise. They are similar to and above C2 and C1. On this floor the corridor is green. To reach it, take the same staircase as you did from the blue corridor to get to the red corridor. Across the staircase are again toilets. In the green corridor you find again firstly room D2 and then D1 on the right side. Also at room D1 be careful for the concrete pillar.
Room D3 is more difficult to find. When you arrive at floor D via the staircase, turn right (not left as you would do for rooms D2 and D1). Pass through an entrance door (be careful, in the opposite direction, you will need a badge). Straight a few steps up and pass again a double door and continue straight ahead. We pass a long corridor with on the right side a railing. Than pass through a single door. Be careful, in the next corridor is on the right side a small wooden stair, this is no entrance for us. Across this wooden stair is the entrance door to the technical office. Continuing beyond the small wooden stair, is on the left side the last room on the second floor, room D3. Be careful, just before this room, the corridor makes a left jump. <br><br>

The fifth floor G can only be reached via the elevator or staircase closest to the lunchroom. If you take this stairs or elevator you arrive directly in room G2. To reach room G1 you have to pass through room G2. Due to safety reasons, it is not allowed to open the windows on this fifth floor! You can only open the window in the toilet room that’s located between the elevator and the stairs.

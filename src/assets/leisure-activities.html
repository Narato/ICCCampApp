<h1>Leisure activities</h1>
<main>

<h2>Some general info</h2>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Several activities will take place on other locations. Of course the visits will, but also the sport activities (except the showdown), and the night game. Transport will happen either on foot, by mini bus or by public transport, depending on the activity. Be aware of that when you subscribe, and make sure you are punctual!
<li>The aim in the escape room on Friday is very simple, to escape the room within the hour.
<li>The aim of the game on Saturday is to, in two teams, solve some puzzles and to get the treasure. The game is accessible for blind participants. In fact, half of the participants will be either blind or blindfolded.
<li>Some activities will take place in a gym. Shoes with black soles or high heels are not allowed there.
<li>The showdown room and the board/card games are available every night. The showdown will be until 22h. The games, which you will have to borrow at the bar by giving your name, should be brought back at 0H45 at the latest.
<li>The movies we will show are The Jungle book, and Pitch Perfect
<dl>
<dt>The Jungle book</dt>
<dd>this is the recent movie adaptation of the Rudyard Kipling story about a boy, Mowgli, who had been raised by a pack of wolves, who leaves on an adventure with the black panther Bagera, and the kind bear Baloo.</dd>
<dt>Pitch Perfect</dt>
<dd>the story of Beca, a freshman at Barden University. She is cajoled into joining The Bellas, her school's all-girls singing group. Injecting some much needed energy into their repertoire, The Bellas take on their male rivals in a campus competition.</dd>

<h3>Monday 31st July</h3>
<p>A fare well party will be organized. During that party, you will be able to perform an act: a song, a sketch, a peace of drama, …. You are free to choose whether or not you want to prepare something, and if you are doing it alone, or with other people. By Thursday evening, we would like you to tell us if you are doing something, and which material you want us to provide.</p>

<h2>How to find your ICC friends</h2>
<p>A facebook- and a whatsapp group have been created for all of you, staff, participants and volunteers, where you can discuss everything, chat about everything, and try to find each other physically.
<ul>
<li>The whatsapp group can be reached with the following link: <a href="https://is.gd/iccmeetingroomwhatsapp">https://is.gd/iccmeetingroomwhatsapp</a>.<br>
When clicking on it, you will be redirected to whatsapp, where you can join the ICC2017 meeting room.
<li>The facebook link to the group is: <a href="https://is.gd/iccmeetingroomfb">https://is.gd/iccmeetingroomfb</a>.<br>
It might be that you have to put this link into the address bar of your browser, and then solve a captcha. Anyway, you can also find the group by searching (icc 2017 meeting room)
</ul></p>
